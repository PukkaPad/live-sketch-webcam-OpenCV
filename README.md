Live Sketch
-----------------------

In this project, I used `OpenCV` to create a live scketch from my webcam input.
I have also saved the frames generated by my webcam.

Usage
-----------------------

* Run `python3 live_sketch.py`.
	* This will turn your camera on and you'll be able to see the countor of your image (see `frame6.jpg`)
    * It will create `framexx.jpg`, for each frame captured. `xx` is the number of frames, starting from 0.


To stop
-----------------------
* Press CTRL + C to interrup.
